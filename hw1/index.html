      <h2>Overview</h2>
      Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think
      about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what
      interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

      <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
      To rasterize triangles, I sampled every point within the bounding box of
      the triangle and rasterized a point for every sample that was inside the
      triangle. Of course, not forgetting to also rasterize the edges of the
      triangle. As mentioned, this algorithm samples every point within the
      bounding box, so it is no worse than it, but also no better than it.

      <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
      Supersampling works by sampling at higher resolutions, then downsampling
      by taking the average. This helps antialias triangles as it provides a bit
      of a blurring effect on the edges, helping to smooth the previously jagged
      pixels due to sharp cutoffs. <br /><br />

      In order to implement this behavior, the sample buffer had to be resized
      so that we can sample it at higher resolutions. To ensure that lines and
      points are still rasterized correctly, the
      <code>fill_pixel</code> function was modified to fill in the surrounding
      area so that the entire pixel will be filled in when we downsample later.
      <br /><br />

      To rasterize triangles, the main modification needed was to scale the
      vertices proportional to the higher resolution sample space. This played
      well with the original algorithm, as it only worked with the position of
      the triangle vertices.

      <h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
      Using rotation and translate transforms, we can make it so the cubeman
      looks like he's on a run. Of course, proper transform groups makes this a
      lot easier.<br />
      <img src="images/task3.png" alt="Task 3" width="400" />

      <h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
      Barycentric coordinates are a way to define a point inside a triangle. It
      uses three coordinates (alpha, beta, gamma) to do so. If the vertices of a
      triangle are A, B, and C, then alpha describes how close the point is to
      vertex A, in proportion to beta and gamma. If it's 1, then it's right at
      the vertex, if 0, then it's as far away from that vertex as it can be.
      Similarly, beta describes that for vertex B, and gamma for vertex C.
      <br /><br />

      For demonstration, take a look at the image below. The top left vertex has
      the color red, the top right green, and the bottom blue. The closer a
      sample point is to the vertex, the more the pixel approaches that vertex's
      color.

      Using barycentric coordinates, we can render the test 7 image of a color
      wheel.<br />

      <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
      Pixel sampling methods determine which pixels of the texture map onto the
      sample. Nearest neighbor sampling selects the nearest pixel in the
      texture, whereas bilinear sampling interpolates between the 4 closest
      points.
      <br />
      <br />
      To implement texture mapping, I used the Barycentric coordinates for each
      pixel to interpolate the UV coordinates of the vertices. Then, I can
      simply sample from the texture using that UV coordinate, making sure to
      map it according to the texture dimensions. The resulting pixel sampled is
      determined by the pixel sampling method.
      <br /><br />

      <div style="display: flex">

        </figure>
      </div>

      With nearest sampling, some details can be missed, like the red vertical
      line. Bilinear sampling helps us capture at least a little bit of that
      information without needing to supersample.

      <br /><br />

      </div>

      Bilinear sampling helps smooth out jagged edges without the need of
      supersampling. However, when we do use supersampling, the difference in
      nearest sampling vs bilinear sampling becomes hard to discern.
      <br />
      <br />
      There will really only be a difference between nearest and bilinear when
      the difference between the current sampling rate and the next (to the
      power of two) is noticeable. For instance, when the sampling rate is 1.
      This is because bilinear sampling is very similar to super sampling, as it
      takes the interpolation of the closest 4 points. Thus, as the difference
      is sampling rates become less noticeable, so too will the difference in
      nearest neighbor and bilinear sampling.

      <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
      Level sampling methods determine which level of the mipmap to use, which
      in turn determines the texture(s) to sample from. Zero level sampling
      defaults to level 0, which is the highest quality texture. Nearest level
      sampling chooses the level that more closely matches the texture frequency
      to the sample frequency, reducing aliases. Bilinear level sampling
      interpolates between the two closest levels to achieve a continuous level
      effect.
      <br />
      <br />
      To implement this, I first computed <code>du/dx</code>,
      <code>dv/dx</code>, <code>du/dy</code>, and <code>dv/dy</code> to use in
      the level calculations. Next, I simply used the formula in lecture 5,
      slide 65 to compute the level. This is sufficient for nearest level
      sampling. <br /><br />
      For bilinear level sampling, I sampled twice, once for
      <code>floor(level)</code> and another for <code>floor(level)+1</code>.
      Then, I linearly interpolated the colors from the resulting samples using
      the fractional amount in the level calculations. The resulting color is
      the output for linear level sampling. <br /><br />
      Here's a look at the tradeoffs between the three methods:
      <br /><br />
